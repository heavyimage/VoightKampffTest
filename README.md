I love blade runner.  And I'm getting into twitter bots...

> Think carefully:  You find a tan toy car abandoned on the street. You show it to your brother. You wish you could keep it safe forever. You comission the creation of a duplicate. Did you ever run away as a child?
>
> We call it Voight Kampff for short.

> You think of a butterfly dying in a trail. It moves towards you, in slow motion. Then You wonder what it's like to decompose. But you're are not helping. How do animals make you feel?
>
> Youâ€™re in a desert walking along in the sand when all of the sudden you look down, and you see an owl. You reach down, you flip it over on its back. You decide to get married. Have you ever harmed an animal?

> *Grins disarmingly*

> You're in a strange building. You can't stop thinking about visiting a school from your childhood. It's good to be back, isn't it? When was the last time you were here?

> *The machine breathes*

> You're watching a stage play. It feels like you're drowning. You can't stop thinking about visiting a river from your childhood. You laugh unexpectedly. Why do you think your best friend abandoned you?

> Please pay attention. You're burying something in the ground. Your grandfather likes it so much, he/she hangs it on your bedroom wall. You realize that it's very comforting. What else do you remember about your childhood?

> Just answer the questions, please -- You find a turtle skull abandoned on the street. You're worried your best friend will take it from you. You wish everyone could tell how important it was to you. What do you do when you're betrayed?

## TODO
* deep options by adding more generic categories:
    * emotionally resonant places (lake / playground / home / school / church)
    * smells
    * tastes
    * sounds
    * physical sensations
    * colors
    * better animal (pets? meat-sources?) / people types
* genericize existing rules with these types!
* better pronouns
* longer stories (maybe contexts that only work in certain slots?)
* Emotional stories to mine: <https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/16tm3v/whats_the_strongest_memory_from_your_childhood/>
* Move strongly specific BR VK questions into 'quips' rather than leveraging their chunks
    * eg: "you were going to play doctor"
