## TODO
* deep options by adding more generic categories:
    * emotionally resonant places (lake / playground / home / school / church)
    * smells
    * tastes
    * sounds
    * physical sensations
    * colors
    * better animal (pets? meat-sources?) / people types
* genericize existing rules with these types!
* better pronouns
* longer stories (maybe contexts that only work in certain slots?)
